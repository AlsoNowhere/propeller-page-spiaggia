# propeller-page-spiaggia
Thank you for viewing this file.

Contained in these six files are two versions of a test site I have been asked to build for an interview process with the creative agency 'Propeller'.

The main version which matches the PSD file and image files sent to copy is named without a version antotation. The second version has files which end with 'v2'.

The main version matches the image file and what exists on the actual website and follows the spec outlined. As I have found a few issues with this version and because I wanted to show how I saw the script working I have created a second version which aims to fixing what I see as errors in the detail.

Below are a few things which I have noticed with the original design:
 - The lunch times for Mon-Fri say 12am (midnight) when it should say 12pm (noon).
 - The content input boxes for 'Join the yacht club' has a colour too similar to the background image which makes it hard to read the text (white for text and light grey for background colour).
 - 'Propeller' buttons have a propeller swipe which is the same colour as the text, meaning its distracting when trying to read the text.

In order to make the web page accurate to the original design despite not hosting the font I have used the following alternative fonts:
FuturaPT Book
is now:
Google-font: 'Muli'.

MuseoSansRounded
is now
Google-font: 'Raleway'.
